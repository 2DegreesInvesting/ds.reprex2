# reprex workshop

## Goal

Create reproducible examples using tilt data and code.

Audience: Project managers (PMs). Developers should also benefit from better
understanding the PMs perspective.

## Why? 

* As a PM I want to want to express what I expect through a reproducible 
examlpe so that developers can turn it into a test and implement my idea.
* As a PM I want to understand tests and to be able to run them so I can see
if the code is actually doing what I expect.

## Objectives

* Overview the most useful features of [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/).
* Find help files and tests in an R package.
* Create reprex-es from examples.
* Create reprex-es from tests.
